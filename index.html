                                                                    it was only through an extensive knowledge of the game, lots of watching professional matches, a competitive drive to win, fast hand eye coordination, awareness of all the variables going on the in game and
                                                                    killer instinct. it was also wanting to prove something. to myself and some friends at the school and my friends back home who also played. 
                                                                    i sort of isolated myself for those years of my life and had some identity struggles and league of legends was something i held on to. when i finally hit diamond in season 5 i was playiny nunu and kogmaw back in the cinderhulk meta. these arent very mechanically intensive champions, i relied on how smart i was being with my abilities, 
                                                                    how i used them in tandem with what my opponents and allies were doing, amrt team fight tactics, and good team communication. hitting it made me feel like i could really do anything. like i was good at something.
                                                                    i was always really good at halo too, i just like getting into my own little world and focusing on something exciting and games always did that for me when i was young, like an escape when i could prove myself.
                                                                    i started out playing halo with my older two brothers after middle school - we'd go to my oldest bros friends house and do four player split screen halo and take turns giving up the controller when we die. it got my into competitive gaming.
                                                                    later on i started becoming fascinated with single player games too like minecraft and skyrim, both of which just have incredible music, always gets me. a game that can either totally put you in zen mode with the amount of
                                                                    concentration required to perform competitively, or just fascinate you with beautiful immersion - these are my two types of games. and it doesn't need incredible realistic graphic, design is most important.
                                                                    that emergent property where it feels like you are still connected to something beautiful when you are playing, and not just going through some simple loop or story line, but have freedom.
                                                                    
                                                                    ive been playing games all my life - i hope one day to get the chance to work on games, whether any aspect of coding, or maybe cooler yet design choices and story choices, balance choices as well
